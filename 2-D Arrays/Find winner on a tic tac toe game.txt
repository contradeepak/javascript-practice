Solution:

   const rows = new Array(3).fill(0);
    const cols = new Array(3).fill(0);
    let diagonal = 0;
    let antidiagonal = 0;
    let player = 1;
    for(let [a,b] of moves) {
        rows[a] += player;
        cols[b] += player;
        if (a === b) diagonal += player;
        if (a === 2-b) antidiagonal += player;
        /* adding on row to check despite any column */
        if (rows[a] === 3 || cols[b] === 3 || diagonal === 3 || antidiagonal === 3) 
            return 'A';
        /* adding on column to check despite any row */
        if (rows[a] === -3 || cols[b] === -3 || diagonal === -3 || antidiagonal === -3) 
            return 'B';
        player *= -1;
    }
    return moves.length === 9 ? 'Draw' : 'Pending';
