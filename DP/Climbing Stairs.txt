70. Climbing Stairs


You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps


Solution :

var climbStairs = function(n) {
        let dp = [0,1,2]

    let currentStep = 3

    while(currentStep <= n){
        dp[currentStep] = dp[currentStep-1] + dp[currentStep - 2]
        currentStep++
    }

    return dp[n]
};
