797. All Paths From Source to Target


Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).


Solution :


var allPathsSourceTarget = function(graph) {
      const result = [];
    
    let dfs = function(node, path){
        if (node === graph.length-1) result.push(path)
        
        for (let neighbour of graph[node]){
            dfs (neighbour, path.concat([neighbour]));
        }
    }
    dfs(0, [0])
    return result;
};
