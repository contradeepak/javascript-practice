162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


Solution:

var findPeakElement = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

        const prev = nums[mid - 1] || -Infinity
        const next = nums[mid + 1] || -Infinity

        if (prev < nums[mid] && nums[mid] > next) return mid;
        else if (next > nums[mid]) left = mid + 1
        else right = mid - 1
    }
};
