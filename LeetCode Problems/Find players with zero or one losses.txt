2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.

Solution:

var findWinners = function(matches) {

    let obj = {}

    for(let match of matches){
        if(!obj[match[0]]) obj[match[0]] = 0
        if(!obj[match[1]]) obj[match[1]] = 0

        ++obj[match[1]]
    }

    let ans = [[],[]]

    for(let [key,value] of Object.entries(obj)){
        if(value === 0){
            ans[0].push(key)
        }
        if(value === 1){
            ans[1].push(key)
        }
    }

    return ans
};
