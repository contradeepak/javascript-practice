191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
 it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Solution:

var hammingWeight = function(n) {
       let str=n.toString(2)
    let c=0
    for(let char of str){
        if(char=='1') c++
    }
    return c
};
