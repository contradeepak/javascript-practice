143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


Solution:


var reorderList = function(head) {
    // find middle
// by moving "fast" twice, we'll have "slow" in the middle
let slow = head
let fast = head
while (fast.next && fast.next.next) {
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
}

// reverse second half
// with reverse linked list solution
let prev = null
let cur = slow.next
while (cur) {
    let temp = cur.next
    cur.next = prev
    prev = cur
    cur = temp
}

slow.next = null

// combine two halves
let h1 = head
let h2 = prev

// if even, second half will be smaller
while (h2) {
    let temp = h1.next
    h1.next = h2
    h1 = h2
    h2 = temp
}
};
