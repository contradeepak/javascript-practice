128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.



var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
      if(!nums.length) return 0;
    
    let count = 1;
    let largestSequence = 0;
    
    nums = new Set(nums);
    nums = Array.from(nums);
    nums.sort((a,b)=> a-b);
   

    for(let i=0 ; i<nums.length ; i++){
        let diff = nums[i+1] - nums[i]; 
        if(diff == 1){
             count++;
        }else{
            if(count > largestSequence){
                largestSequence = count;
            }
            count = 1;
        }

    }
    return largestSequence;;
};
