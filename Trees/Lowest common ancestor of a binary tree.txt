236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


Solution :


var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    if (!root || root === p || root === q) return root;
  var resL = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
  var resR = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
  return (resL && resR) ? root : (resL || resR);
};
